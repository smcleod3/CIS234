# Items_For_Sale_App
This is a browser based items for sale app as a web application.
Summary: This application is designed for users to sell things they no longer need or want on a webserver like Microsoft Edge or Chrome (for example). There are no accounts, service logins, or software to download. The data entered lives only on the device from which it is created.

There are only four pages to the entire site (index.html, new_item.html, edit_item.html and about.html) one style sheet, notes.css, and one main JavaScript file to control app functions storage.js. The site makes use of Bootstrap version 5 for layout and convenience.
